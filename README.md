GTPE Data Science Boot Camp Module 5 Challenge

This repository includes 2 folders: .ipynb_checkpoints (automatically generated by Jupyter) and Pymaceuticals. The Pymaceuticals folder is pulled from the Module 5 class directory, containing csv files with the information to analyze and a starter Jupyter notebook.

The repository also contains a Jupyter Notebook file called pymaceuticals, which pulls information from the csv files in Pymaceuticals and forms them into Pandas dataframes for analysis using matplotlib, numpy, and scipy.
